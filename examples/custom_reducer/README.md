# Custom Reducer Example

This example demonstrates how to use custom reducers for state management in LangGraphGo.

## Overview

Reducers define how updates from nodes are merged into the current state. While `AppendReducer` is common for lists of messages, you can define custom logic for any state field.

This example shows how to implement a custom reducer that aggregates values or handles complex merge strategies.

## Usage

```bash
go run main.go
```
