# Configuration Example

This example demonstrates how to use `RunnableConfig` to pass runtime configuration to your graph.

## Overview

Configuration allows you to pass metadata, tags, callbacks, and other settings through the execution context. This is useful for:
- Tracking execution IDs
- Passing user IDs
- Configuring callbacks
- Setting recursion limits

## Usage

```bash
go run main.go
```
